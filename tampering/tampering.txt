Question: Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Answer: The vulnerability stems from sending the "name" property as an unsanitized string
within the request, making it susceptible to cross-site scripting attacks. This allows attackers
to manipulate the input and potentially compromise the security of the system.
The secure version mitigates this vulnerability by sanitizing all properties and variables
received in the request, preventing unauthorized manipulation.
