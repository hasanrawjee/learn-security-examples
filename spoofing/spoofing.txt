Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The vulnerability in insecure.js stems from its permission for programmatically setting
session information due to the absence of cookie.httpOnly being set to false. This opens
avenues for malicious users to exploit session hijacking or execute cross-Site request
forgery attacks. The secure version addresses this vulnerability by ensuring that
cookie.httpOnly is set to true, thereby restricting unauthorized access to session data
and preventing potential attacks.
