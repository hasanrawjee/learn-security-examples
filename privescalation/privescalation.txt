Question: Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Answer: Within insecure.js, when a user accesses the /update-role endpoint, there's a lack of authentication
mechanisms to validate the user's identity. Thus, implementing robust authentication protocols would enhance
its security.

Question: What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Answer: We can add a strong authentication mechanism, for example 2FA.
