Question: Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Answer: The insecure.js script lacks proper error handling when querying the database, making
it vulnerable. In the event of an error, the server may crash, rendering it inaccessible
to legitimate users.

Question: What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Answer: We could incorporate a rate limiting system as simply implementing an error handling
mechanism won't suffice; the server remains susceptible to DDoS attacks, potentially rendering
it inaccessible to genuine users. Additionally, we can enhance security by sanitizing incoming parameters.
